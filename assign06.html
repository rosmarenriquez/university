                        <h3>Our History</h3>
                        <p>R University is more than 100 years old. It was established by an act of the Mexican Parliament 
                            in 1874 "for the purpose of providing a complete education to everyone who wanted to become a better person".
                            R University graduates have established a reputation of service and achievement around the world. They have 
                            distinguished themselves in all aspects of Mexican education.</p>
                        <p>
                            We were also the first University to give external students the opportunity to continue to earn a living while studying, 
                            and to study privately and take exams without coming to Mexico City.
                            Since then we have expanded and modernised, becoming a pioneering institution that was the first to make higher education 
                            available to women and those unable to pursue traditional forms of study.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The University during the War</h3>
                        <p>
                            The University had great impact for those who were serving during the First and Second World Wars in the Armed Forces or 
                            had been prisoners of war. Many continued studying and passed exams, ultimately paving the way for a life after the wars. 
                            To the present day our degree programmes can be accessed by prisoners in some countries, allowing for new opportunities or a 
                            fresh perspective of the world.
